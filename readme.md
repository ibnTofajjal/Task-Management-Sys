# Task Management System

You are asked to implement a Django `Task Management System` project where anyone can add a task under different categories, edit the tasks, and delete the tasks. You need to create a model i.e

**TaskModel** having fields

- taskTitle
- taskDescription
- is_completed by default False
- Task Assign Date

N.B : Here `is_completed` field should be of type models.BooleanField and default values for this field should be `False`

**TaskCategory Model** will have

- Category Name
- Many-to-Many Relationships with task model

In this project, users should be able to:
Add a navigation bar where user will see **Add Task**,**Add Category**, **Show Tasks menu**

In the **Show Tasks** Page users can see all the tasks in **bootstrap card** style, for every task there will be two buttons **Edit** and **Delete** . For **completed tasks** the user won't see the **edit** and **delete** button rather see **Completed**.

An User can e**dit the task, delete the task, complete the task.** When a task is **completed** then the** is_completed will be True**.

In the **Add Task Page**, users can see a **form based on the task model form**, can provide **title**, **description**, can **select multiple categories**, **Is Completed** and then submit the form and the data must be added to the database and then **redirect** the user to the** Show Tasks page**. You must use the model form here.

In the **Add Category page**, users can add a category by **its name**. Use model form here

Following requirements must be filled :
There must be two apps named **task** and **category**
Global templates for **base.html** and and app templates for showing forms in both apps
